  # on a non-NixOS system that has some libraries installed that are not
  # installed in Nix (for example, Arch Linux has jpeg2000 but Nix doesn't
  # build Pillow with this support). We patch the `disable_platform_guessing`
  # setting here, instead of passing the `--disable-platform-guessing`
  # command-line option, since the command-line option doesn't work when we run
